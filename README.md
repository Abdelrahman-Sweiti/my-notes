### I am a freshly graduated software engineering student with a passion for developing with C# and .NET Core. I am excited to take on new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills and grow as a developer. With the dream of building my own tech company alongside a group of my friends, I am constantly seeking ways to learn and hone my skills to help make that dream a reality.
